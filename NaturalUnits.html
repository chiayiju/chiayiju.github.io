			Picture a scenario where you're at a mall with your friend who just return from another country. How would you react if this friend saw the pricetag of a backpack and said "Can you imagine that I bought the exact same thing for 200 during my trip?" <br /><br />

			I'm sure most people will be confused — "Which currency?" Without specifying the currency, this number "200" is meaningless; it could be extremely expensive or cheap. <br /><br />

			The same problem happens in laboratories as well. If a scientist tells you that a device weighs "250," there is no way to judge whether the device is heavy or light unless we have prior knowledge about the device and/or the scientist. <br /><br />

			Therefore, to avoid confusion, we need a way to provide people with an intuitive sense of how much the device weighs. One approach is to compare its weight to a familiar object, for example, a chicken. Instead of stating "250," the scientist could say that the device weighs 1/10 of a chicken's weight. If we have a rough idea of how much a chicken weighs, this comparison helps us estimate the device's weight easier.

			<p style = "position: relative; line-height: 1.5; text-decoration: underline;" class = "text-section">Units</p>

				Therefore, to describe a quantity more efficiently, we need to compare it to something; and that "something" is the unit. In the previous example, to determine how much a device weighs, we compare it to the weight of a chicken. The chicken's weight is then the unit for measuring how heavy an object is. <br /><br />

				For different quantities, we need different units. We wouldn’t measure the distance between Alice and Bob’s homes using the weight of a chicken, but we could compare it to the distance between Alice’s house and the local supermarket. For a time period, we could compare it to how long it takes for someone to take a shower. Similarly, to determine how fast a person runs, we could compare it to the speed of the dog that's chasing the person. <br /><br />

				Nevertheless, the aforementioned units cannot serve as standard scientific units. For starters, we don't know which chicken was used as the unit for weight, the distance between a house and a local supermarket is not precise, a person's shower time can vary daily, and the dog's runing pace could depends on the reason for running. Secondly, these things or events do not last forever. Lastly, I don’t want to chase a chicken down just to figure out how much I weigh — both the chicken and I might have already lost some weight during the "exercise."

			<p style = "position: relative; line-height: 1.5; text-decoration: underline;" class = "text-section">SI Units</p>

				Therefore, scientists, engineers, traders, and anyone dealing with physical quantities need a set of standard, universally accepted units. The idea sounds simple, but finding such a set is not an easy task. And we’re not even talking about the level of building devices that match the definitions of the units, but about what kinds of unit definitions can be considered “standard” and “universal.” <br /><br />

				To begin with, in order to describe the physical quantities we encounter in everyday life, we seem to need a never-ending list of unit definitions: time, temperature, length, speed, energy, etc. It is nearly impossible to write down a separate definition for every physical quantity. <br /><br />

				Luckily, although it may seem that we need a large number of units, it was soon realized that we don’t actually need a separate unit for every quantity. Rather, most quantities can be derived from others. For example, to describe how fast a person runs, we use the quantity called speed, which is determined by how far the person travels over a period of time. Therefore, the unit of speed can be derived from the definitions of the units for length and time. In other words, rather than defining a new unit every time we identify a new physical quantity, we look for base units from which all known units can be derived. <br /><br />

				Among all unit systems, the International System of Units, or SI units (French: Système international d'unités), is probably the most widely adopted one. In the SI system, only seven base units need to be defined: time (second), length (meter), mass (kilogram), electric current (ampere), temperature (kelvin), luminous intensity (candela), and amount of substance (mole). All other units for various physical quantities can be derived from these seven base units. <br /><br />

				Besides defining the abstract base units, a proper unit system needs to provide precise definitions for those units. For example, in the SI unit system, the second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of a cesium-133 atom. As for length, since the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, the meter is defined as 1/299,792,458 of the distance light travels in a second. <br /><br />

				But why is a second defined as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the transition radiation, and a meter is one 299,792,458th of the distance light traveled? Why not just make the numbers 9,000,000,000 and 300,000,000? <br /><br />

				One of the major reasons is that these numbers lead to the values closest to the previous definitions of the second and the meter. The new definitions weren't meant to change the "size"; they are merely intended to make them more precise and "universal." <br /><br />

				Take time as an example: it was once based on the apparent position of the sun. However, not only is this definition less precise and useless after sunset, but the apparent motion of the sun progresses at different rates depending on location. Later, people realized that the periods of swinging pendulums are nearly the same everywhere on Earth, so pendulum motion was used to define the unit of time. Nevertheless, due to technological advancements and the need for a valid definition beyond Earth, the time unit had to be redefined to match the precision and universality. <br /><br />

				Therefore, the base units are defined through barely changing physical phenomena and constants to make them as universal as possible. To be more specific, since the transition frequency of radiation emitted and absorbed between two energy levels of an atom is highly consistent, we use this phenomenon to define the time unit so that a second is the same on Earth and Mars. <br /><br />

				In other words, these definitions in the SI unit system are, to some extent, historical. One reason we continue to use the same set of units, aside from the fact that changing them could cause social disruption, is that they are closely aligned with human experience. Humans are roughly one to two meters tall, and a few seconds is about how long you have to react when a lion sees you.

				Despite the fact that the SI unit system is very useful in business, engineering, and even education, it does not necessarily work as well when it comes to science. Here, we introduce another unit system that is even more universal and perhaps better suited to the needs of some physicists. <br /><br />

				I suppose many of us have been annoyed by how unpleasant the gravitational constant \(G \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} ~ \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}^{-2}\) looks (especially when the professor doesn't mention whether this number will be provided on the exam or not). I know that many of us even ignore the constant in our scratch work and only put it back in for the submitted versions. It seems important, but when we trace back to the origin of this number \(G\), we found that it is nothing more than a proportional constant between the gravitational force \(F_\text{g}\) and other physical quantities, namely, \(\dfrac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\). In other words, the main purpose of \(G\) is only to ensure the equation \(F_\text{g} = G \dfrac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\) holds. <br /><br />

				Of course, we might suspect that because Newton was English, expressing the gravitational constant in "English units" would make the value neater. At least, that's what I thought when I was little. But a quick calculation shows that \(G \approx 1.069 \times 10^{-9} ~ \text{lbm}^{-1} \cdot \text{ft}^3 \cdot \text{s}^{-2}\) in English unit — still not any better. <br /><br />

				Well, if we really think it through, it's no surprise. The value of the gravitational constant isn’t determined by whoever writes it down — only nature can decide what value it takes. <br /><br />

				This is true for all physical constants. For example, the speed of light \(c \approx 2.997 \times 10^{8} ~ \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}\) and the reduced Planck constant \(\hbar \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34}~\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-1}\) are also determined by nature and are considered universal. But we, as humans, can always construct a set of units that makes the values of these constants appear more satisfactory.

				We, therefore, look for a unit system that makes the numerical value of these physical constants equal to one. With a quick scan of those constants, we find that only three quantities are involved, namely, mass, length, and time. That gives us just enough degrees of freedom to set the numerical values of three constants (\(\hbar\), \(G\), and \(c\)) to one. To be more specific, we can construct three new units — Planck mass (\(m_\text{p}\)), Planck length (\(\ell_\text{p}\)), and Planck time (\(t_\text{p}\)) — such that \(G = 1 ~ m_\text{p}^{-1} \cdot \ell_\text{p}^3 \cdot t_\text{p}^{-2}\), \(c = 1 ~ \ell_\text{p} \cdot t_\text{p}^{-1}\), and \(\hbar = 1 ~ m_\text{p} \cdot \ell_\text{p}^2 \cdot t_\text{p}^{-1}\). <br /><br />

				Straightforward calculations show that \(m_\text{p} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}\), \(\ell_\text{p} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}\), and \(t_\text{p} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}}\). In terms of our beloved SI units, the values are \(m_\text{p} \approx 2.176 \times 10^{-8}~\text{kg}\), \(\ell_\text{p} \approx 1.616 \times 10^{-35}~\text{m}\), and \(t_\text{p} \approx 5.394 \times 10^{-44}~\text{s}\). <br /><br />

				In addition to simplifying the constants, the universality of physical constants (maybe except the gravitational constant \(G\), due to the absence of a full theory of quantum gravity) renders these units well-defined anywhere and anytime in the universe. <br /><br />

				Off the record, there’s a conspiracy theory quietly circulating among many physicists: Nature is secretly a fan of Planck units and only behaves sensibly at the Planck scale — when everything is conveniently sized around just a few Planck units.

			<p style = "position: relative; line-height: 1.5; text-decoration: underline;" class = "text-section">Natural Units</p>

				Although Planck units are already considered universal and simplify the numerical values of physical constants, in theoretical physics, especially in high energy physics, we tend to use a similar but distinct unit system — natural units. In this system, the focus shifts from the units themselves to the universal constants. <br /><br />

				Specifically, if we look more closely at the underlying concept of Planck units, particularly why they are considered universal, we immediately realize that their universality is derived/transferred from the physical constants. Since these constants are already universal by nature, assigning units to them becomes redundant. <br /><br />

				For example, since the speed of light \(c\) is constant, why not just make it equal to <strong>one</strong>? And I don't mean "one length over time," I mean a number with no dimension (i.e., no unit). To be more specific, we define the universal constant \(c = 1\). <br /><br />

				However, choosing \(c = 1\) leads to \(1~\text{s} \approx 2.997 \times 10^8~\text{m}\), meaning that the unit of length becomes equivalent to the unit of time. At first glance, this might seem like a ridiculous equivalence — or is it? <br /><br />

				Look at the definition of a meter in the SI unit system: it's defined as a fraction of the distance light travels in one second. This means that, implicitly, a meter is defined through \(c\), which relates length and time. Although it may seem like this definition only applies to objects moving at the speed of light, everything with non-zero mass (electrons, protons, quarks, you, me) is "traveling at the speed of light" in spacetime. Yes, if you take relativity into account, even when we’re not moving through space, we are traveling at the speed of light in the time direction. Yes, if you take relativity into account, even when we’re not moving through space, we are traveling at the speed of light in the time direction. So in fundamental physics, where relativistic effects are essential, setting \(c = 1\) is actually a very natural and reasonable assumption. <br /><br />

				As a matter of fact, this is equivalent to defining a new time variable as the original time multiplied by the speed of light \(c\), i.e., \(t =  c \tilde{t}\), where \(t\) is the newly defined time and \(\tilde{t}\) is the "conventionally defined" time. Therefore, the new time carries the unit of length. <br /><br />
				
				Interestingly, in addition to time carrying the unit of length, setting \(c = 1\) also causes mass to carry the unit of energy. This follows from the famous relation:
				\[
					E = m \quad (E = m c^2).
				\] <br />

				As a side note, this is also why the mass of an electron is often written as \(0.5~\text{MeV}\), and the Higgs boson as \(125~\text{GeV}\). It is standard to express the masses of elementary particles in units of energy. If you really want to know their values in traditional "mass unit," just divide by \(c^2\). <br /><br />

				If we further choose \(\hbar = 1\) then, since \(\hbar\) carries the unit of energy times time, we find that the unit of energy becomes equivalent to the inverse of the time (or length) unit. In other words, by setting \(c = 1 = \hbar\), mass has the same unit as energy, and both space and time units become the inverse of energy. <br /><br />

				Although this unit system may feel less familiar from everyday experience, if you're one of us who believe that the fundamental laws of physics should be simple and elegant, you might also agree that those laws are best expressed in natural units. As an example, consider the appearance of \(\hbar\) in the quantum time evolution operator, \(\exp(-i t \hat{H} / \hbar)\). Without \(\hbar\), the argument in the exponent would carry the unit of angular momentum, which is not dimensionally valid. Nevertheless, \(\hat{H}\) carries units of energy, which is the inverse of the time unit in the natural units with \(c = 1 = \hbar\). So the product \(t \hat{H}\) is already dimensionless, and the time evolution operator simplifies to \(\exp(-i t \hat{H})\), without the need to introduce an artificial constant to cancel out the units. <br /><br />

				As a consequence, not only are the physical equations less camouflaged by unnecessary constants, but, at least from my point of view, natural units also tend to make more conceptual sense.

		<h2>Covariant Derivatives</h2>
		
		We first recall that, in Catesian coordinate system, a vector field can be expressed as
		\[
			\vec{f} = f^i(x) \hat{e}_i,
		\]
		where the \(\hat{e}_i\) form a basis, and \(f^i(x)\) is a function depending on the coordinates \(\lbrace x^1$, \(x^2\), \(\cdots\rbrace\). However, we can also choose the basis to be coordinate-dependent, namely,
		\[
			\vec{f} = f^i(x) \hat{e}_i(x).
		\]
		
		In this case, a partial derivative with respect to a coordinate becomes
		\[
			\partial_i \vec{f} = \left( \partial_i f^j \right) \hat{e}_j + f^j \left( \partial_i \hat{e}_j \right)
		\]
		\[
			= \left( \partial_i f^j \right) \hat{e}_j + f^j \left( \Gamma^k_{ij} \hat{e}_k \right)\\
			= \left( \partial_i f^j + \Gamma^j_{ik} f^k \right) \hat{e}_j,
		\]
		where \(\partial_i \equiv \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$. The second equality [from \eqref{diff1} to \eqref{diff2}] follows from the fact that the derivative of \(\hat{e}_i\) remains within in the same space and can therefore be expanded in terms of the same \(\hat{e}$'s.
		
		Following the same derivation, we find that for a second-rank tensor,
		\[
			\overleftrightarrow{T} = T^{jk} \hat{e}_j \hat{e}_k,
		\]
		the partial derivative becomes
		\[
			\partial_i \overleftrightarrow{T} = \left( \partial_i T^{jk} + \Gamma^j_{i\ell} T^{\ell k} + \Gamma^k_{i\ell} T^{j \ell} \right) \hat{e}_j \hat{e}_k.
		\]
		
		Since finding notation for a third- (or higher-) rank tensor (maybe \(\overset{\uparrow}{\overleftrightarrow{R}}$?) is to too much work, and for the sake of clarity, differential we only focus on the components. To be more specific, we define
		\[
			\nabla_t \phi & = \partial_i \phi \label{CovDiff0}\\
			\nabla_i f^j & = \partial_i f^j + \Gamma^j_{ik} f^k, \label{CovDiff1}\\
			\nabla_i T^{jk} & = \partial_i T^{jk} + \Gamma^j_{i\ell} T^{\ell k} + \Gamma^k_{i\ell} T^{j \ell} \label{CovDiff2},
		\]
		which generalizes natually to any finite-rank tensor. Here, the \(\phi\) is a scalar or an order-zero tensor, and since there is no \(\hat{e}$'s involved in the derivative, there is no \(\Gamma\) term.
		
		These are called the ``covariant derivatives,'' although their origin lies in the standard partial derivative. For convenience, we often refer to \(f^i\) as the vector (abuse of the terminology), despite the fact that it's just the component of the vector.
		
		While the \(\Gamma$'s are determined if \(\hat{e}$'s are specified, not every choice of \(\hat{e}_i\) is reasonable. For noew, the \(\Gamma$'s here are consider undeteremined (yet) and we'll use other conditions to fix them.

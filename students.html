					Welcome! If you are interested in joining our research group, please read the following information before reaching out. Our approach might be very different from what you expected, and I want to ensure that you are prepared for it.
					<ol>
						<li class = "major">We Don't Teach, We Train</li>
						<p class = "discription">
							We don't provide standard lectures in this group. Instead, we focus on training students to become independent researchers. This means you will need to actively explore concepts, develop your own understanding, and push the boundaries of what is known.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Self-Learning Is Essential</li>
						<p class = "discription">
							Students in our group must have both the <strong> ability and willingness </strong> to learn by themselves. If you rely on structured teaching or expect step-by-step guidance, this may not be the best fit for you.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Small Group, Different Research Paths</li>
						<p class = "discription">
							For better training, we only take a limited number of students. As a result, you will likely be working on very different margin-topics from your peers. This means that you cannot always rely on senior students for help, and you will need to navigate challenges on your own.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Communication Skills Matter</li>
						<p class = "discription">
							Research is not just about solving problems; it’s also about explaining your work clearly. Presentation skills are a key part of our training, and you will be expected to learn how to communicate your research effectively.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Minimal Coding Involvement</li>
						<p class = "discription">
							Although most students have the impression that coding skills are important in theoretical physics research (which is generally true), our research involves very little coding. While you are welcome to use computational tools to assist your work, I will neither intervene nor provide support for coding-related tasks.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Required Background Knowledge</li>
						<p class = "discription">
							You must be prepared to learn certain foundational margin-topics:<br />
							<span style = "position: relative; left: 2rem">- Required: Quantum mechanics and differential geometry (you don’t need to master them before joining, but you must be willing to learn them).</span><br />
							<span style = "position: relative; left: 2rem">- Recommended: Basic understanding of relativity, quantum field theory, supersymmetry, and string theory.</span>
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Research Has No Predefined Answers</li>
						<p class = "discription">
							Unlike homework problems, research questions do not come with known answers. No one will be able to confirm if your results are correct until they are reviewed and/or publicized. This means:<br />
							<span style = "position: relative; left: 2rem">- You must verify your own results before claiming them.</span><br />
							<span style = "position: relative; left: 2rem">- Developing a strong sense of rigor and self-criticism is essential.</span>
						</p>
					</ol>
					If you are excited by these challenges, feel free to reach out. Meanwhile, I would also suggest that you look around and see if there is a research group that suits you better before making any rushed decisions.

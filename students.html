					Welcome! If you are interested in joining our research group, please read the following information before reaching out. Our approach might be very different from what you expected, and I want to ensure that you are prepared for it.
					<ol>
						<li class = "major">We Don't Teach, We Train</li>
						<p class = "text">
							We don't provide standard lectures in this group. Instead, we focus on training students to become independent researchers. This means you will need to actively explore concepts, develop your own understanding, and push the boundaries of what is known. Most importantly, you will have to establish the ability to identify errors.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Self-Learning Is Essential</li>
						<p class = "text">
							Students in our group must have both the <strong> ability and willingness </strong> to learn by themselves. If you rely on structured teaching or expect step-by-step guidance, this may not be the best fit for you.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Small Group, Different Research Paths</li>
						<p class = "text">
							For better training, we only take a limited number of students. As a result, you will likely be working on very different topics from your peers. This means that you cannot always rely on senior students or peers for help, and you will need to navigate challenges on your own.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Communication Skills Matter</li>
						<p class = "text">
							Research is not just about solving problems; it’s also about explaining your work clearly. Presentation skills are a key part of our training, and you will be expected to learn how to communicate your research effectively.
						</p>

						<li class = "major">Required Background Knowledge</li>
						<p class = "text">
							You must be prepared to learn certain foundational margin-topics:<br />
							<span style = "position: relative; left: 2rem">- Required: Quantum mechanics and differential geometry (you don’t need to master them before joining, but you must be willing to learn them).</span><br />
							<span style = "position: relative; left: 2rem">- Recommended: Basic understanding of relativity, quantum field theory, supersymmetry, and string theory.</span>
						</p>
					</ol>
					If you are excited by these challenges, feel free to reach out. Meanwhile, I would also suggest that you look around and see if there is a research group that suits you better before making any rushed decisions.

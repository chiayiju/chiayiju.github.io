			Physics is the study of Nature. Rather than stopping at the level of "whatever goes up must come down," we study how it goes up and why it eventually comes back down.<br>

			Most theories in physics originate from experience and observation; therefore, physical theories are usually practical but complicated in their early stages. Nevertheless, they evolve as we understand them better. Specifically, not only do the theories become more powerful in their practical applications, but they also take on neater forms. Although these evolved forms often appear less intuitive, they sometimes offer deeper insights into the heart of nature.<br>

			Elecetromagnetism, as an example, begins with the daily-life phenomena of some minerals attracting or repelling each other and static electricity that causes the tiny sparks when taking a sweater off. Later, with the quantitative studies on charged objectes and magnets, the notion of electric and magnetic fields emerge. However, the relations among electric, magnetic fields, and their sources are very complicated; so complicated that we can barely understand them, not to mention to find new phenomena. Fortunately, they were later unified into a simple form called the Maxwell's equations. From there,

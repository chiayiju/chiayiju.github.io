				Picture a scenario where you're at a mall with your friend who just return from another country. How would you react if this friend saw the pricetag of a backpack and said "Can you imagine that I bought the exact same thing for 200 during my trip?"
			</p>

			<p style = "margin-bottom: 2rem;">
			I'm sure most people will be confused — "Which currency?" Without specifying the currency, this number "200" is meaningless; it could be extremely expensive or cheap.
			</p>

			<p style = "margin-bottom: 2rem;">
				The same problem happens in laboratories as well. If a scientist tells you that a device weighs "250," there is no way to judge whether the device is heavy or light unless we have prior knowledge about the device and/or the scientist.
			</p>
			<p style = "margin-bottom: 2rem;">
				Therefore, to avoid confusion, we need a way to provide people with an intuitive sense of how much the device weighs. One approach is to compare its weight to a familiar object, for example, a chicken. Instead of stating "250," the scientist could say that the device weighs 1/10 of a chicken's weight. If we have a rough idea of how much a chicken weighs, this comparison helps us estimate the device's weight easier.

				<p style = "margin-bottom: 2rem;">
					Therefore, to describe a quantity more efficiently, we need to compare it to something; and that "something" is the unit. In the previous example, to determine how much a device weighs, we compare it to the weight of a chicken. The chicken's weight is then the unit for measuring how heavy an object is.
				</p>

				<p style = "margin-bottom: 2rem;">
					For different quantities, we need different units. We wouldn’t measure the distance between Alice and Bob’s homes using the weight of a chicken, but we could compare it to the distance between Alice’s house and the local supermarket. For a time period, we could compare it to how long it takes for someone to take a shower. Similarly, to determine how fast a person runs, we could compare it to the speed of the dog that's chasing the person.
				</p>

				<p style = "margin-bottom: 2rem;">
					Nevertheless, the aforementioned units cannot serve as standard scientific units. For starters, we don't know which chicken was used as the unit for weight, the distance between a house and a local supermarket is not precise, a person's shower time can vary daily, and the dog's runing pace could depends on the reason for running. Secondly, these things or events do not last forever. Lastly, I don’t want to chase a chicken down just to figure out how much I weigh — both the chicken and I might have already lost some weight during the "exercise."
